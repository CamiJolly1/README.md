## How Github is going so far for Cami...

| Pros | Cons |
| --- | --- | 
| -  I can write really pretty | - I don't know if I'm doing this in the right place | 
| - I know how to create pull requests | - It took me a while to figure it out |
| - I know how to fork projects | - I don't know how to add colors correctly using md | 

**Anyways, _besides that,_ I feel like I have a better understanding of what is going on now**

**I'm sorry that I was late when doing this, even if you don't grade it I wanted to check it out**
